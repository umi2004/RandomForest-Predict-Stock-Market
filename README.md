This project focuses on predicting tomorrow's S&P 500 index price using historical data. It also addresses common issues that lead to overfitting in stock price models.

The process begins with downloading S&P 500 prices using the `yfinance` package. The data is then cleaned and prepared for analysis using pandas. 

A random forest model is trained and evaluated using backtesting methods. Additional predictors are incorporated to improve the model's performance. The project concludes with potential next steps for further enhancements.
